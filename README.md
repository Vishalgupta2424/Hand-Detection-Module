# Hand-Detection-Module

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Real-time Hand Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV! ðŸ¤–ðŸ’»

I developed a Python application that utilizes Mediapipe's hand tracking tools and OpenCV to detect and track hands in real-time from a webcam feed. This project includes:

âœ¨ Utilization of Mediapipe's pre-trained models for accurate hand landmark detection. 

âœ¨ Customized visualization of hand landmarks and connections with OpenCV. 

âœ¨ Dynamic messaging displaying whether left, right, or both hands are detected in the frame.

âœ¨ Timestamp display to track real-time updates.
